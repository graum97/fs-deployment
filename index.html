    <p>You may think that you know the story of Frankenstein, but you're likely wrong. See Frankenstein is the scientist responsibe for the creation of the Creature that the general public thinks is Frankensein. The Creature does not have a true name; he is either the Creature or Frankenstein's Monster.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you've seen a movie featuring Frankenstein's Monster, even they don't do justice to the original tale. The only movie that ever came close to Mary Shelly's original test was a silent film from 1910. So unless you've seen that film, or read the book, you really don't know the story.</p>

    <h2>Read Frankenstein Today!</h2>
    <h3>Or at the Very least, Watch the Silent Film</h3>
